# ``ticguide`` : quick TESS data and observing info

Complementary to the TESS observing tool [``tvguide``](https://github.com/tessgi/tvguide) (see also [WTV](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py)), which tells you if your target *will be* observed by TESS (i.e. on silicon, guaranteed FFI coverage), this tool tells you if your target ***was**** observed by TESS in other cadences (i.e. short- and fast-cadence). * **this draws only from available MAST observations and therefore does not inform you of upcoming sectors.** 

### UPDATE: New 0.5.0 version will even download the data for you!

## Installation
You can install using pip:

``` bash
$ pip install ticguide
```

or via the github repository:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ashleychontos/ticguide.git
$ cd ticguide
$ python setup.py install
```

You can check your installation with the help command:

```
♡ ~/tics % ticguide --help
usage: ticguide [-h] [--version] [--download] [--fast] [--fileinput str]
                [--fileselect str] [--fileall str] [--ll int] [--path str]
                [--progress] [--save] [--short] [--star [int ...]] [--totals]
                [--verbose]

## Examples

The program uses the MAST bulk downloads scripts to assemble a list of observed
TIC ids to then generate the relevant material the user wants, whether it be the
observed sectors and/or cadences or the actual data (yes, you read that right!).

CLI example (it may take a minute to run through all observed sectors, since it's
a lot now):

```
♡ ~ % tiguide --star 141810080

```

^^ as shown by the progress bar, the program iterated through 84 bash scripts. This 
makes sense since if TESS is currently on sector 55, which means there are 55 short-cadence 
and 29 fast-cadence sectors available (-> 55+29=84).

Command line easily handles multiple TIC IDs by appending them to a list:

```
♡ ~/tess % ticguide --star 141810080 441462736 188768068

**The new download feature can be seen by the second progress bar. Even if
you didn't use the download option (`-d` or `--download`), the program assumes
there is some interest in the selected targets and therefore creates a bash
script per target in the same way MAST provides bulk download scripts per sector!**

To initialize the scripts, simply run the above command with the `-d` flag:

```
♡ ~/tess % ticguide --star 141810080 441462736 188768068 -d
```

... and watch it go. To keep everything nice and neat, it will create
a parent directory called 'targets' and make one folder per target, where
the target's light curves will be downloaded to!

If you have many many targets, you can instead provide a single-column txt or csv file, with targets
listed by their TIC id (one entry per line).

```
$ head todo.csv

tic
141810080
188768068
441462736
```

A boolean table `selected_tois.csv` is created using the provided list of targets (TICs) as the table indices and all unique
combinations of the cadences and sectors as columns, where `True` would mean a given TIC was observed in the listed
cadence and sector. For example, the column "S027" means short-cadence sector 27 observations, whereas "F027" is the 
same sector but in fast cadence.
